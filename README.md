# cs260-week-2-assignment
designing a queue using pseudocode, lots of writing, and maybe some crude drawings which remind me why I'm not a Graphic Design major if I find the time.

As a student, I'm never sure how much detail I should go into when delving into pseudocode. I try to find a happy medium between what's shown in https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/how-to-design-your-first-programs/ and a more written explanation. There will be times where I swap between the two, and I try to provide reasoning as to why in the moment. I'll be adapting how I do all this pretty heavily based on any feedback you give to this assignment.

Thanks in advance for taking the time to review all this. Have a cool duck I found.
